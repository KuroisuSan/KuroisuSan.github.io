I am a senior graduate from [School of intelligent systems engineering](https://ise.sysu.edu.cn/), [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes computer vision and artificial intelligence production content.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Xiaodan Liang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=voxznZAAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) of Human Cyber Physical Intelligence Integration Lab from [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/).
